# Li-po-battery-discharges-simulation
This code simulates how a Li-po battery discharges over time and displays how the voltage decreases on a graph. You can adjust battery specifications such as discharge rate and initial capacity as needed. This code shows the progression of time and when the discharge ends as a specific voltage is reached.
